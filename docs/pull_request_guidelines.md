# Pull Request Guidelines
*Last updated: 2026-04-01*

This document summarizes how to properly format a pull request for the **Cicero_V2** repository.

## Steps Before Opening a PR

1. **Lint and test the project** using:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm test
   ```
   Fix any issues reported by `eslint` or failing tests.
2. **Make sure the working tree is clean** with `git status --short`.
3. **Write descriptive commit messages** that explain the change.

## Formatting the Pull Request

- Provide a **concise title** that summarizes the purpose of the PR.
- In the body, list the main changes and reference file paths or line numbers when they help reviewers.
- Mention related issues or context so others understand why the change is needed.
- Keep the description short but informative.

Refer to [docs/naming_conventions.md](naming_conventions.md) for code style guidelines.
