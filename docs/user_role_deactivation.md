# Role-aware user deactivation

This document outlines how Cicero handles per-role removals and user deactivation when operators or services request status changes.

## Helper: `deactivateRoleOrUser(userId, roleName?)`

- Reads the user's active roles from `user_roles`.
- If `roleName` is provided and other roles remain, only that role link is removed while keeping the user active.
- If the removed role is the last one _or_ no role is provided, the helper flips `status` to `false`.
- All changes run inside a transaction so role rows and the `user` table stay consistent with `removeRole` semantics.

## WhatsApp operator menu

- The **Ubah Status User** flow now lists active roles.
- When a user has multiple roles and the operator chooses **Nonaktif**, the menu prompts for the target role to remove before applying `deactivateRoleOrUser`.
- The confirmation message shows which role was changed and which roles remain active.

## Bulk deletion requests (`clientrequest` menu)

- Each entry determines a target role when a user has multiple roles (prefers the primary/flag role).
- The helper removes just that role; users stay active if other roles remain.
- WhatsApp numbers are cleared only when the resulting user status becomes `false`.
- The summary message includes the role that was removed and the final status per entry.

## REST: `DELETE /users/:id`

- Accepts an optional `role` parameter (query string or request body).
- Delegates to `deactivateRoleOrUser`; if a role is supplied, only that role is removed unless it was the last one, in which case the user is deactivated.
- Without `role`, the endpoint deactivates the user directly.

## Testing

Jest coverage now includes multi-role cases:

- Removing a specific role while other roles keep the user active.
- Removing the last role sets `status` to `false`.
